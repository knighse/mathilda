## The web scraper for Wish Lily

Wondering how we provide Etsy, Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart, and Target search results and products without breaking a sweat? A web scraper! (duh)

This web scraper is written in Deno because they've got a nice li'l free hosting service that runs on the edge, so it's really cool to have it running our API for latency reasons.

Unfortunately, it is not necessarily public nor documented, but I won't stop you from using our stuff if you really want to ;)

Anyways, if you do end up stealing my code, **please consider giving my app a looksie** at [wishlily.app](https://wishlily.app/?utm_source=MathildaDocs)
